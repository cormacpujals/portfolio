      <h1>About Cormac</h1>
      <p>As a full stack web developer, I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. Before pursuing web development, those passions brought me to applied economic research where I worked for the European Central Bank on initiatives to improve the economic welfare of individuals through increased firm productivity. 

After realizing how much I enjoyed programming and building end-user experiences, I pivoted to web development and I haven’t looked back since! In my free time, I climb rocks, and tell dogs they’re good dogs. </p>
